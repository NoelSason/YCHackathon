# Dev log

What each push did and why. Put the newest entry at the top. Every push must add or update an
entry; the pre-push hook and CI block pushes that don't change this file. See "Dev log" in
`AGENTS.md` for the rules.

This is the team's build log. It isn't the company's agent activity log, which the demo uses.

## Entry template

```markdown
### YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM PT · <person> (<agent or "by hand">) · branch `<branch>`

**What:** one to three lines on what changed.
**Why:** the problem or goal behind it.
**Files:** the main files or directories touched.
**State:** works / partly works / broken, and how you checked.
**Next / heads-up:** what's left, what teammates should know, what not to touch.
```

### 2026-11-07 13:00 PT · Noel (Claude Code) · branch `main`

**What:** Publisher plan now uploads to YouTube through Monid. TikTok and Instagram stay on
Mobilerun phones, and the YouTube app on a phone is the fallback.
**Why:** Monid may give a simpler, more reliable YouTube path than driving the app.
**Files:** `README.md`.
**State:** Unverified. Monid's YouTube endpoint hasn't been found or tested yet (no API key yet).
**Next / heads-up:** Noel checks the endpoint with `monid discover` once the key is added.

### 2026-11-07 12:55 PT · Noel (Claude Code) · branch `main`

**What:** Added `README.md` with the idea (autonomous streaming studio with clipping), the six
agents, each person's plan, the timeline, demo metrics, and risks. Updated `AGENTS.md` to point
to it and added a fourth ownership row for business ops.
**Why:** One shared plan, so everyone's agents build toward the same loop.
**Files:** `README.md`, `AGENTS.md`.
**State:** Docs only. The plan's split for teammate 4 is a proposal.
**Next / heads-up:** **Abhinav:** the streaming spike (can a Naïve agent get gameplay onto a
stream?) decides the architecture. Pick a path by 3:00 PM. **Everyone:** agree on the shared
contracts at 3:00 PM. **Teammate 4:** put your name in `AGENTS.md` and `README.md`.

### 2026-11-07 12:45 PT · Noel (Claude Code) · branch `main`

**What:** Added "Team and ownership" to `AGENTS.md`. Noel: iOS research and Mobilerun. Max: video
generation. Abhinav: Naïve SDK agents and the platform.
**Why:** So every teammate's agent knows whose area it's in and flags cross-area changes.
**Files:** `AGENTS.md`.
**State:** Docs only.
**Next / heads-up:** Each owner adds their directory to "Repo layout" in `AGENTS.md` when they
create it.

### 2026-11-07 12:40 PT · Noel (Claude Code) · branch `main`

**What:** Added the Monid skill (v0.1.9) to the repo so every teammate's Claude Code gets it.
Monid is a sponsor tool: one CLI that gives access to hundreds of data and scraping endpoints.
**Why:** Agents should check Monid before anyone writes a scraper or data integration by hand.
**Files:** `.claude/skills/monid/SKILL.md`.
**State:** CLI installed and `monid setup` run on Noel's machine. No API key added yet, so
nothing has run through Monid.
**Next / heads-up:** Each teammate installs the CLI (`npm install -g @monid-ai/cli@latest`),
creates an account at https://app.monid.ai/?aid=hacks for the signup credit, and adds their own
key with `monid keys add -k <key> -l main`. Never commit a Monid key. Runs spend the account's
balance.

### 2026-11-07 12:32 PT · Noel (Claude Code) · branch `main`

**What:** Repo setup. Added `AGENTS.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, this log, a pre-push hook that blocks
pushes unless `log.md` changed, and a GitHub Actions check that does the same on the server.
**Why:** Give every teammate's coding agent the same hackathon context and rules, and keep a
running record of what each push was for.
**Files:** `AGENTS.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, `log.md`, `.githooks/pre-push`, `.github/workflows/log-check.yml`.
**State:** Hook syntax checked and its no-op case tested. Not tested end to end against a real
push yet.
**Next / heads-up:** Each teammate runs `git config core.hooksPath .githooks` once after cloning.
The company, agents, and repo layout in `AGENTS.md` are still TBD.
