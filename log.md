# Dev log

What each push did and why. Put the newest entry at the top. Every push must add or update an
entry; the pre-push hook and CI block pushes that don't change this file. See "Dev log" in
`AGENTS.md` for the rules.

This is the team's build log. It isn't the company's agent activity log, which the demo uses.

## Entry template

```markdown
### YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM PT · <person> (<agent or "by hand">) · branch `<branch>`

**What:** one to three lines on what changed.
**Why:** the problem or goal behind it.
**Files:** the main files or directories touched.
**State:** works / partly works / broken, and how you checked.
**Next / heads-up:** what's left, what teammates should know, what not to touch.
```

### 2026-11-07 12:58 PT · Noel (Claude Code) · branch `main`

**What:** Fourth teammate added. They own business ops: the Ops agent, spend tracking, sponsors
and sales, and the demo dashboard and script. Abhinav goes back to the platform plus Streamer and
Chat.
**Why:** The team is four people again, and this takes the heaviest load off Abhinav.
**Files:** `README.md`, `AGENTS.md`.
**State:** Docs only. The new teammate's name is still TBD.
**Next / heads-up:** **Teammate 4:** put your name in `AGENTS.md` (Team and ownership) and
`README.md` (agents table and your plan section).

### 2026-11-07 12:56 PT · Noel (Claude Code) · branch `main`

**What:** Plan changed to fit three people and what Monid can actually do.
- Monid key added from `.env`. The account has $20 signup credit (`MONID-SIGNUP`, already
  redeemed).
- **Monid can't upload to YouTube.** Every YouTube result only reads data. The Publisher now posts
  to YouTube, TikTok, and Instagram from Mobilerun phones, with the YouTube Data API as the
  fallback. Monid is for research, view counts, and Max's video generation models.
- **The team is three people.** Removed teammate 4. Abhinav takes the Ops agent, Max takes sales
  as a stretch goal, and Noel takes the demo script. Added a cut order for scope.
- Corrected the times on the three entries below. They were written ahead of the clock.
**Why:** The plan was built on two wrong assumptions: a fourth teammate, and Monid uploading
to YouTube.
**Files:** `README.md`, `AGENTS.md`, `log.md`.
**State:** Docs only. Monid's search was tested live. No run was charged.
**Next / heads-up:** **Abhinav:** you now own Streamer, Chat, Ops, and the platform. Read the cut
order in `README.md`.

### 2026-11-07 12:48 PT · Noel (Claude Code) · branch `main`

**What:** Publisher plan now uploads to YouTube through Monid. TikTok and Instagram stay on
Mobilerun phones, and the YouTube app on a phone is the fallback.
**Why:** Monid may give a simpler, more reliable YouTube path than driving the app.
**Files:** `README.md`.
**State:** Unverified. Monid's YouTube endpoint hasn't been found or tested yet (no API key yet).
**Next / heads-up:** Noel checks the endpoint with `monid discover` once the key is added.

### 2026-11-07 12:46 PT · Noel (Claude Code) · branch `main`

**What:** Added `README.md` with the idea (autonomous streaming studio with clipping), the six
agents, each person's plan, the timeline, demo metrics, and risks. Updated `AGENTS.md` to point
to it and added a fourth ownership row for business ops.
**Why:** One shared plan, so everyone's agents build toward the same loop.
**Files:** `README.md`, `AGENTS.md`.
**State:** Docs only. The plan's split for teammate 4 is a proposal.
**Next / heads-up:** **Abhinav:** the streaming spike (can a Naïve agent get gameplay onto a
stream?) decides the architecture. Pick a path by 3:00 PM. **Everyone:** agree on the shared
contracts at 3:00 PM. **Teammate 4:** put your name in `AGENTS.md` and `README.md`.

### 2026-11-07 12:44 PT · Noel (Claude Code) · branch `main`

**What:** Added "Team and ownership" to `AGENTS.md`. Noel: iOS research and Mobilerun. Max: video
generation. Abhinav: Naïve SDK agents and the platform.
**Why:** So every teammate's agent knows whose area it's in and flags cross-area changes.
**Files:** `AGENTS.md`.
**State:** Docs only.
**Next / heads-up:** Each owner adds their directory to "Repo layout" in `AGENTS.md` when they
create it.

### 2026-11-07 12:40 PT · Noel (Claude Code) · branch `main`

**What:** Added the Monid skill (v0.1.9) to the repo so every teammate's Claude Code gets it.
Monid is a sponsor tool: one CLI that gives access to hundreds of data and scraping endpoints.
**Why:** Agents should check Monid before anyone writes a scraper or data integration by hand.
**Files:** `.claude/skills/monid/SKILL.md`.
**State:** CLI installed and `monid setup` run on Noel's machine. No API key added yet, so
nothing has run through Monid.
**Next / heads-up:** Each teammate installs the CLI (`npm install -g @monid-ai/cli@latest`),
creates an account at https://app.monid.ai/?aid=hacks for the signup credit, and adds their own
key with `monid keys add -k <key> -l main`. Never commit a Monid key. Runs spend the account's
balance.

### 2026-11-07 12:32 PT · Noel (Claude Code) · branch `main`

**What:** Repo setup. Added `AGENTS.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, this log, a pre-push hook that blocks
pushes unless `log.md` changed, and a GitHub Actions check that does the same on the server.
**Why:** Give every teammate's coding agent the same hackathon context and rules, and keep a
running record of what each push was for.
**Files:** `AGENTS.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, `log.md`, `.githooks/pre-push`, `.github/workflows/log-check.yml`.
**State:** Hook syntax checked and its no-op case tested. Not tested end to end against a real
push yet.
**Next / heads-up:** Each teammate runs `git config core.hooksPath .githooks` once after cloning.
The company, agents, and repo layout in `AGENTS.md` are still TBD.
