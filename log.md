# Dev log

What each push did and why. Put the newest entry at the top. Every push must add or update an
entry; the pre-push hook and CI block pushes that don't change this file. See "Dev log" in
`AGENTS.md` for the rules.

This is the team's build log. It isn't the company's agent activity log, which the demo uses.

## Entry template

```markdown
### YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM PT · <person> (<agent or "by hand">) · branch `<branch>`

**What:** one to three lines on what changed.
**Why:** the problem or goal behind it.
**Files:** the main files or directories touched.
**State:** works / partly works / broken, and how you checked.
**Next / heads-up:** what's left, what teammates should know, what not to touch.
```

### 2026-11-07 12:32 PT · Noel (Claude Code) · branch `main`

**What:** Repo setup. Added `AGENTS.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, this log, a pre-push hook that blocks
pushes unless `log.md` changed, and a GitHub Actions check that does the same on the server.
**Why:** Give every teammate's coding agent the same hackathon context and rules, and keep a
running record of what each push was for.
**Files:** `AGENTS.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, `log.md`, `.githooks/pre-push`, `.github/workflows/log-check.yml`.
**State:** Hook syntax checked and its no-op case tested. Not tested end to end against a real
push yet.
**Next / heads-up:** Each teammate runs `git config core.hooksPath .githooks` once after cloning.
The company, agents, and repo layout in `AGENTS.md` are still TBD.
